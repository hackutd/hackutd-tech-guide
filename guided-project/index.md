# Guided Project

Written By: HackUTD Experience 2024/2025! ❤️

## Welcome to HackUTD Lost in the Pages!

This guided project is for hackers who need help getting started with creating a **full-stack application**. It comprises multiple sections that will go from creating the front end to creating a backend to calling APIs.

For your benefit, we will have plenty of external resources to reference throughout the process. Don’t forget that Google is your best friend! Furthermore, we have mentors on deck at all times so feel free to come down to the lobby or take a visit to DevHour an event where a team of mentors are available to help you with any issue you may run into.

Remember: The most important thing to do at a hackathon is to learn. Copying and pasting all of this code into your IDE will do you **zero good** and will simply be a waste of your time.

Have passion, aspire for excellence. You are capable! Apply yourself and everything will work out.

## FAQ:

-   **This is not my first hackathon, am I still allowed to use this?**
    -   We encourage anyone with even the slightest bit of experience to build their own unique and creative solution. However, we still believe this to be an incredibly powerful resource to help you instantiate your project. And who knows, maybe you’ll find the inspiration to pivot to take on one of our challenge statements.
-   **Can I do this project and turn it into something else?**
    -   Yes! Though there is a major time crunch of 24 hours, say you crank out this guide within a few hours and feel ready to build something on your own… go for it! Even transforming this project with a new concept and design is an effective way of exercising creativity.
-   **I finished the project with a lot of time left, what now?**
    -   This is where you can express your creativity and differentiate your project from the others! The [bonus](/guided-project/Bonus.md) page of this guide shows the next steps after completion. A few general options include:
        -   Restyling the UI to look more appealing
        -   Integrating more APIs
        -   Altering the purpose of the project itself with new functionality and theme.
        -   Pivot to a Challenge Statement
            -   _Note_: If you decide to pivot away, you cannot submit to the Guided Project track.
