## ✈️ Airport to UTD

Arriving at either DFW International Airport or Love Field Airport, you have 3 options:

- Uber/Lyft - ~$35 for Lyft, ~$25 for Uber, a ~30 minute commute
  - Uber’s rates drop significantly if you walk a little ways from the airport (for ex. take an Uber from Belt Line DART Station)
- Train/Bus - a 2hr, $3-6 commute
    1. Public transportation only runs between 5am to midnight!
    2. Download the GoPass app and buy an AM, PM, or day pass
    3. Click the Plan tab (bottom left) and navigate to UTD or just use [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/DFW+International+Airport,+2400+Aviation+Dr,+DFW+Airport,+TX+75261/University+of+Texas+at+Dallas,+West+Campbell+Road,+Richardson,+TX/@32.8913835,-96.9523579,12z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x864c2a660d222aa7:0x73323f5e067d201c!2m2!1d-97.0403352!2d32.8998091!1m5!1m1!1s0x864c21ff895e4aa5:0xd9098b32e9aa1331!2m2!1d-96.7502474!2d32.9856974!3e3?entry=ttu)
- Find a friend to pick you up - it’ll be better than the first two options!
