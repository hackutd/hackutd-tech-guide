## About the Company

Hey — we’re T-Mobile, the Un-carrier. We ditched the old telecom playbook (you know, hidden fees, confusing fine print, contracts that feel like shackles) and built something better. When we say, “no bull,” we mean it. We’re here to make wireless simple, fair, and freaking awesome.
 
At this hackathon, you’re not just pitching ideas — you’re joining a movement. We want coders, tinkerers, dreamers who say, “challenge accepted.” Build with us. Break what doesn’t work. Engineer something to enhance customer experience. Your prototype could become part of how millions connect.
 
So, swing by our booth. Dream big and build your wildest ideas. Let’s power up some magenta magic together!
