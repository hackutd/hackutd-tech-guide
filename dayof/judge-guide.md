## Team Registration

Your team needs to be **registered by 11:00pm on Saturday**. **YOU MUST HIT SUBMIT ON THE FINAL SCREEN OR YOU WILL NOT BE REGISTERED.** Donâ€™t worry, you do not have to have your whole project done by this time. This is just to make sure your team is registered on **[Devpost](https://hackutd-2025.devpost.com/).** You will have until 12:00pm on Sunday to fully submit your project.

Follow this guide on how to register your team: **[Devpost Guide](devpost-guide.md)**

# ðŸ‘¥ Team Formation

The maximum number of members in a team is 4. Donâ€™t worry if you donâ€™t have a team â€” a hackathon is a great place to meet new people! After the opening ceremony, we will have a teambuilding session where you can find people to hack with. Additionally, we will provide a teambuilding channel in **[Discord](https://discord.gg/DVy4xdG57s)** where you can find teammates.

Your project needs to be finalized by **12:00pm** (**noon) on Sunday**! No edits should be made to your project after that time. Make sure you have at least the following:

- Project Title and Description
- Challenges/Tracks you are submitting to
- Code Repo (i.e GitHub) or Zip file
- **Demo Video** (should ONLY be a demo - not your entire presentation, maximum of 2 minutes)
