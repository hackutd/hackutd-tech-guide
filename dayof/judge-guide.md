## Team Registration

Your team needs to be **registered by 11:00pm on Saturday**. **YOU MUST HIT SUBMIT ON THE FINAL SCREEN OR YOU WILL NOT BE REGISTERED.** Don’t worry, you do not have to have your whole project done by this time. This is just to make sure your team is registered on **[Devpost](https://hackutd-2025.devpost.com/).** You will have until 12:00pm on Sunday to fully submit your project.

Follow this guide on how to register your team: **[Devpost Guide](devpost-guide.md)**

# 👥 Team Formation

The maximum number of members in a team is 4. Don’t worry if you don’t have a team — a hackathon is a great place to meet new people! After the opening ceremony, we will have a teambuilding session where you can find people to hack with. Additionally, we will provide a teambuilding channel in **[Discord](https://discord.gg/DVy4xdG57s)** where you can find teammates.

Your project needs to be finalized by **12:00pm** (**noon) on Sunday**! No edits should be made to your project after that time. Make sure you have at least the following:

- Project Title and Description
- Challenges/Tracks you are submitting to
- Code Repo (i.e GitHub) or Zip file
- **Demo Video** (should ONLY be a demo - not your entire presentation, maximum of 2 minutes)

# Judging

Projects need to submitted on **[Devpost](https://hackutd-2025.devpost.com/).** A few important things to note:

- Judging is done **_in-person_**.
- All teams will be given a table to set up their presentation below (see sheet below, will be linked on Sunday).
- You’ll be judged **multiple times** over the course of 3 hours and should stay for the entire time

### Judging Tips

- Have a compelling 30 second pitch that clearly explains why **your** solution is useful to grab the attention of judges.
- A functional live demo of your project is the best way to **show** what you have accomplished.
- Support your demo with a brief presentation that explains the problem you're solving, the tech stack you used, and the project's future steps.
- Presenting with enthusiasm and positive body language (despite the possible lack of sleep) shows the judges you are passionate and proud of your work, which leaves a good impression.
