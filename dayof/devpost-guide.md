## ü§î What is Devpost?

Devpost is an online platform where developers showcase projects, participate in hackathons, and connect with companies and other builders. For HackUTD: Lost in the Pages we use Devpost to collect team registrations and final project submissions.

If you need help at any point, ask a HackUTD officer or reach out through the event channels.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Registering your team (quick method)

To register your team you just need to create a blank project with the companies you are interested in and submit it! This will be editable until the end of hacking time (11/9 12:00pm CST). We do this to avoid any last minute issues with Devpost and to gauge interest in company challenges.

**Registration deadline:** We would like for your team to be registered on Devpost by 11:00pm on 11/8! When registering your team please choose all the Companies and Tracks you are most interested in competing for.

1. In Devpost, go to "My Projects" and click "Create Project".

2. Invite teammates: open "Manage Team" and invite all teammates (required for prize eligibility).

3. Project Overview: for a registration-only project you can set the title to your team name or "Team Registration" and use the elevator pitch to list teammates or a short idea.

---
4. Project Details: fill required fields with placeholder text such as "Team registration" if you don't have final copy yet.

5. Additional information: choose the sponsor tracks you are considering (select at most 2 sponsor/company tracks). For now you can use a placeholder video link (replace it later with your final demo) and a placeholder repository if needed.

Quick tip: creating a registration project early helps avoid last-minute Devpost issues and helps organizers gauge interest in company challenges.

## ‚úÖ Checklist before final submission

Complete these before you finalize your Devpost post. Check items as you go.

### Essentials
- Team registered on Devpost
- All teammates invited to the project
- Public repository linked (required)

### Media & presentation
- Demo video uploaded and linked (public)
- Screenshots or GIFs added
- Project thumbnail (optional but recommended)

## Troubleshooting & tips

- Don't leave the repository private. Submissions with private repos risk disqualification.
- Submit early and update: Devpost allows edits, so submit a working version early and iterate.
- If a teammate doesn't appear as invited, double-check their Devpost account email and resend the invite.
- If you run into Devpost technical issues, try a different browser or clear cache. Contact HackUTD officers if the issue persists.
