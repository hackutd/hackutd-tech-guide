## 🛎️ Check-in Process

We will be checking in at the **front doors of ECSW starting at** **8 AM**. This is for people who have QR codes from pre-registration. You will need your:
- Driver's License or Student ID
- QR Code from the **[legend.hackutd.co](https://legend.hackutd.co)** site

You need to checked-in by **10:00 AM**. If you aren’t checked-in by then, **your spot may be given away**, so make sure to show up by then.

***If you do not have a QR code, you have not been accepted. If you still want to attend you can try you luck at walk-ins.***

Think you might be late? Check out **[Late Check-in](#late-check-in)**

## 🚶‍♀️ Walk-ins

We will still be allowing walk-ins on a **first-come, first-served basis** on the day of the event. We start handing out tickets to walk-ins **starting at 6:00 AM** on Saturday, November 8th by **ECSW**. Spots are limited, so be sure to arrive early to secure your place. Once you get your walk-in ticket, you do not need to stay near ECSW. At **10:00 AM**, we will **start calling ticket numbers** to be let in, so make sure you’re back at ECSW at that time! We will also send you a text message if your ticket number is called.
