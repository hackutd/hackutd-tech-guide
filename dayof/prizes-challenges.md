### StateFarm

#### Challenge

In this 24-hour hackathon challenge, build a tool that compares responses from two versions of a service by sending the same request to both and identifying any differences in their outputs. You will design and implement your own example service and front end as needed.

The service should support operations such as creating and retrieving data, with input and output structured in JSON. Some differences between versions—like generated IDs during creation—are expected and should be flagged as acceptable. Unexpected differences, such as mismatched fields or error statuses, indicate potential issues.

Your tool must perform a deep comparison of the responses, clearly reporting all discrepancies while distinguishing expected from unexpected differences. Provide a concise summary highlighting any regressions or inconsistencies.

This challenge tests your ability to design, implement, and validate service behavior across versions, ensuring smooth evolution and reliable upgrades.

### Goldman Sachs

#### Challenge

Problem Statement:

Traditional vendor and client onboarding processes are often manual, fragmented, and prone to inefficiencies, leading to significant delays, increased operational costs, and heightened security risks. These processes frequently lack robust privilege management, making it difficult to enforce the baseline control requirements. Furthermore, the absence of integrated fraud detection mechanisms during onboarding exposes organizations to financial losses and reputational damage from fraudulent entities or activities. A unified, intelligent solution is needed to streamline these critical business functions while bolstering security and compliance.


Solution Overview:

The challenge is to develop a ""Secure & Intelligent Onboarding Hub"" – a comprehensive platform that automates and secures the entire lifecycle of vendor and client onboarding. This solution should integrate control requirements and advanced fraud detection capabilities, leveraging AI/ML to enhance efficiency and security. 
 

Components to Consider Building:

Onboarding portal to submit the required information for onboarding and reviews for vendors/clients via dynamic UI forms.
Automated workflow engine to manage the onboarding process, verification, approvals, dynamic routing based on the assessments.
Security assessment module to validate compliance with the baseline security controls requirements based on the type of the vendor/client including but not limited to identity and access management, encryption, logging/monitoring, network security, etc.
Privacy module to identify involvement of any personal data (PII) during or after the onboarding process, flag it accordingly and provide a masking solution where feasible. 
Fraud detection and risk scoring module for real-time monitoring, scoring and alerting based on the behavioral patterns and data.
Audit and Reporting dashboard for administrators to monitor onboarding progress and for leadership to get overall metrics.

Sample Datasets/Resources

Kaggle's vendor/client management datasets
Supplier datasets on data.gov
Public marketplace onboarding processes "

### EOG


#### Challenge
CauldronWatch: The Potion Flow Monitoring Challenge

Deep within Poyo’s Potion Factory, dozens of enchanted cauldrons bubble away, collecting potions from brewing towers spread across the facility. Each cauldron fills at its own pace before courier witches swoop in to haul the precious brews to the Enchanted Market. Every collection is logged using Potion Transport Tickets detailing how much potion was collected and when the journey finished.

But lately, something’s amiss! Potion volumes don’t quite match the transport tickets, and rumors of unlogged potion drains are spreading through the halls.

Your task is to develop a real-time Potion Flow Monitoring Dashboard that tracks potion levels across all cauldrons, identifies collection events, and checks the Potion Transport Tickets to detect any missing or unlogged potion. The system should automatically flag inconsistencies, identify suspicious activity, and help ensure every drop of potion is properly accounted for.

You’ll receive historical and real-time cauldron level data, Potion Transport Ticket records, and a map of the potion network linking each cauldron to the Enchanted Market. Use these to visualize the entire operation, monitor live potion flows, and test your real-time detection logic.

✨ Bonus: Extend your system to forecast brew levels and optimize courier routes — helping witches plan efficient pickup schedules, prevent cauldron overflows, and keep the potion trade flowing smoothly across the realm. hackutd2025.eog.systems
