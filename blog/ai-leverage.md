A major problem with the current generation's new talent is that many of them have an over-reliance, or sometimes even a complete dependence, on Artifical Intelligence. We use it to study, to finish school work, code projects, and even to complete daily tasks. In this article, we will explore the detriments of AI and learn how to properly use it for your personal benefit.

## What does misuse of Artificial Intelligence look like?

- You often go straight to an LLM for help before even attempting to solve the problem with your own thoughts.
- You cannot code projects without the use of LLMs.
- You have a poor understanding of your class material because you use AI to complete all of your assignments.

## Why is this so bad?

Look, I get it. AI is super convenient and honestly pretty impressive. But here's the thing - when you rely on it for everything, you're basically letting your brain muscles atrophy. It's like using a calculator for 2+2 every single time instead of just knowing it.

I've seen friends who literally can't write a simple for loop without asking ChatGPT. That's terrifying if you think about it. What happens when you're in an interview or exam situation? You're screwed.

Plus, when you use AI to do all your homework, you're not actually learning anything. You might get the grade, but you'll be completely lost when the material builds on itself later. Trust me, professors can usually tell when something was AI-generated anyway.

## How to use AI the right way

**Try it yourself first.** This is huge. Spend at least 15-20 minutes wrestling with a problem before you even think about opening ChatGPT. You'd be surprised how often you can figure it out on your own if you just give yourself a chance.

**Use AI as a tutor, not a cheater.** Instead of asking "write my essay about climate change," try "can you explain the greenhouse effect in simple terms?" Use it to understand concepts, not to do the work for you.

**Learn from the AI's responses.** When you do use AI for help, don't just copy and paste. Actually read through what it gives you and try to understand why it works. Ask follow-up questions. Make it explain its reasoning.

**Set boundaries for yourself.** Maybe make a rule that you can only use AI after you've tried something yourself, or only for certain types of tasks. Some of my friends have "AI-free" study sessions where they put their phones away and work through problems the old-fashioned way.

**Use it for brainstorming and research.** AI is actually great for getting started on projects or exploring ideas. Ask it to help you outline an essay or suggest different approaches to a coding problem. Just make sure the final work is your own.

## The bottom line

AI isn't going anywhere, so we need to learn to live with it properly. Think of it like having a really smart study buddy who's available 24/7. You wouldn't let your study buddy do all your homework for you, right? Same principle applies here.

The goal is to use AI to enhance your abilities, not replace them. When you do that, you'll actually become more capable and confident in your skills. Plus, you'll be way better prepared for real-world situations where you might not have AI to fall back on.

So next time you're about to ask ChatGPT to solve your problem, take a step back and ask yourself: "Can I at least try this first?" Your future self will thank you for it.
